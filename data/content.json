Our geography team starts by studying official maps and geographical data to ensure each country's shape is as accurate as possible.

For small countries and island nations, we pay special attention to scale and proportion to ensure they're identifiable in the quiz format. The process for each country can take several days, including research, design, testing, and refinement based on player feedback.",
